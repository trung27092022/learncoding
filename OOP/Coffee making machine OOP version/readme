* UPDATE 29th June 2024: The same coffee making machine program as in the other directory, but in this case, it's within the OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) methodology.

- The code is much shorter and much easier-to-understand.
- This introduces more abstraction to the coding, and gives the programmer(s) more opportunities to include more complexities (more easily, too).
